        b. Allow for long-term goal tracking
    2. Pomodoro timers

        b. Play sounds when timers start/finish
    3. Water reminder
        a. Set an interval to be reminded to drink water at - finished
        b. Pop-up, or message which needs to be confirmed - finished
        c. Intrusive with sound, or unintrusive but potentially missed (tbd, or option)?
